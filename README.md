- ðŸ‘‹ Hi ! 
Behind all serious world views, religions and philosophies, there is always one central question:
"Why is it so beautiful on the rhine?"
;-)

Do you really believe in nonsense or is there more to know about God and humanity and life ?

Be surprised:
Jesus loves to laugh, but he has also real answers to real life (and death) questions !
